This is one of the most basic projects in which you can start to clear the concept of HTML & CSS. In this project, you will have one HTML and one CSS file. You can download and play around with the code to make it better. It is one of the most basic layouts that every developer needs to practice. 

I have used properties like Flexbox and grids in this project, you can learn about them or implement them if you already know about them.
